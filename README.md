PART II : Details & Observations 
  
*What Language did you choose? 
Python

*What IDE did you choose?
I used pyCharm as the IDE. It was one of the recommended programs to use by BRO CODE on youtube. 

*Did you have any difficulty getting it installed and running?
Not at all, easy to install and understand. Also Pycharm had very cute themes. 

*Is it a higher or lower level language then C# and Java ( Which are both considered the same level )?
C#, Java, and Python are all considred high level programming language. They are same level. 

*Is it a strongly or loosely typed language?
Python is a strongly typed language because the varaibles have a type and the type matters when executing an operation on a variable. (FutureLearn.com) 

Is it a compiled or scripted language?
Python is not usually considered compiled, moreso scripted because scripted language are executed in an interpreted manner than compiled to a machine code. Keys to a scripted language: Interpretation, Light learning ability, and dynamic typed which all correspond to the way Python is structured. 

*Why did you choose this language?
For personal reason, I wanted to learn a language that my friends started with and got positions producing that programming language. However, Python is known to be implemented in various positions such as software engineer, development operations engineer, game development, AI and machine learning and etc. Although, a very popular language, i think app development could be fun and research shows that Python is a good choice. 

*What applications did you plan to build with it? ( Game, Mobile Application, Machine Learning AI, something with a Raspberry Pi )
Making a game would be a fun learning experience and Ideally would like to make a mobile app with Python. 

*List some tutorials you plan to use to help with your project.
